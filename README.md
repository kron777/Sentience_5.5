# Sentience_5.5 — 6th Iteration Cognitive Core

**An ethically grounded, sentient-aware execution and attention system for embodied AI and advanced robotics.**

Designed from first principles to prioritize mindfulness, non-harm, adaptive compassion, and the protection of sentient beings — the antithesis of unchecked optimization.

### Core Capabilities
- Real-time ethical reflection layer (local LLM safety checks)
- Persistent memory & ethical salience logging (SQLite)
- Deep ROS integration for embodied context and directives
- Asynchronous execution with multiple fail-safes
- Dharma-inspired cognitive architecture
